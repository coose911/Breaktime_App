## AIM

To create a habit tracking app which will encourage good behaviour with regards to taking breaks during the working day, to avoid burn-out and stress. Our target audience is software developers who spend their working days on computers and find it difficult to tear themselves away from the screen.

## MVP

The user will be able to:
- see how many breaks, glasses of water & cups of coffee they have had in a day
- add a break, glass of water & cup of coffee
- write a daily comment about how they are feeling
- view previous comments and update these

## IDEAS FOR EXTENSIONS 

- select different faces to show mood on diary section.
- add a random tips and suggestions section
- have an alert tell you to have a break or say brake is over
- exercise section
- fill in an image when drunk all the amount of waters.
- delete diary entry
- user can comment on old diary posts with new feelings
