# BreakTime

<!-- ![Punk Pints app showing a selected beer, the had list & the want list](src/images/punk-pints.png) -->

## The Brief

Our first group project at CodeClan! Our aim was to create a habit tracking app which would encourage good behaviours with regards to taking breaks during the working day. Users can record waters/coffees drank, and breaks taken, and view weekly summaries of these in charts created using the Highcharts library. There is also a Breathe feature intended to guide the user in a moment of meditation and give a sense of relaxation.

**Group Project | Timescale - 6 days**

## How to Use

On the dashboard: 

1. Click to record a break has been taken, either by clicking on the stressed face, or by selecting a break length and clicking on the clockface.
2. Select a 1 or 2 minute meditation. This will automatically direct you to the Breathe feature for your selected amount of time. The animation is designed to encourage the user to breath in time with it's movements, to promote relaxation and a sense of calm.
3. Click to record a coffee or glass of water has been drank. The pie chart updates dynamically to reflect this consumption.
4. Record how you're currently feeling. Do you feel rested? Has taking more breaks helped with your productivity?

Use the large yellow buttons to navigate between the dashboard, Breathe feature, diary, and graphs pages. The diary page shows a full history of your entries. The graphs page shows a summary of your breaks, and coffee/water consumption accross the week
